#                   MENTAL HEALTH SUPPORT PLATFORM

#Our mental health support platform, developed using Java and Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA), offers a comprehensive array of functionalities to aid individuals in their journey towards better mental well-being. From mood tracking and journaling features to personalized recommendations, our platform leverages robust DSA techniques to ensure efficient data management and seamless user experiences. With a focus on user privacy and accessibility, our platform serves as a reliable companion for anyone seeking support and guidance in navigating the complexities of mental health.
Dr. Kalpesh Patil, Medical and Psychiatry Counselor educated as Clinical Psychiatrist  with 5 years of experience in Med and Psychiatry at AFMC, Pune. He recently founded Shantiban Mental Healthcare Centre. He helped us in understanding different mental health disorders and how important it is to talk about this issue. Under his guidance and information given by him, we made two questionnaires for analyzing the users mental health score and tracking their progress accordingly. “DSM5TR” and “ICD10” are the two books recommended by him which helped us in gathering information about different mental health disorders.

#Error-Free Implementation
To ensure seamless development and robust execution of our mental health support platform, it's imperative to establish a solid development environment. This includes integrating essential tools such as the Java Development Kit (JDK) and Eclipse IDE (Integrated Development Environment).
1. Java Development Kit (JDK):
The JDK provides a comprehensive set of tools for developing Java-based applications. By leveraging the JDK, our development team gains access to a rich library of functions and utilities, facilitating efficient coding and debugging processes. Additionally, JDK offers a robust runtime environment, ensuring compatibility and smooth execution across various platforms.
2. Eclipse IDE:
Eclipse serves as a powerful development platform for building Java applications. Its intuitive interface and extensive feature set empower developers to write, test, and debug code with ease. Eclipse offers advanced functionalities such as syntax highlighting, code completion, and integrated debugging tools, enhancing productivity and code quality.


Program Execution Workflow:

To ensure a smooth and error-free execution of our mental health support platform, the workflow for running the program:

1. Change Directory (cd):
cd path/to/source/code/directory


2. Compile Java Source Code (javac):
javac filename.java

3. Execute Java Program (java):
java filename
java filename
